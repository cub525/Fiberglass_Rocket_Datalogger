# Fiberglass_Rocket_Datalogger
 A fiberglass rocket project with dataloggers

A while ago a friend and I bought a rocket kit, built it, and launched it with a datalogger.
We are doing it again this time making our own rocket out of fiberglass (from soller composites)
The planned datalogger is an ATMEGA328 with Accel, Mag, Gyro, Barom, Alt, Temp etc. (and Telemetry, GPS if we get around to it)
